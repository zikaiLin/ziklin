## Save EPS Figures in R Plotly



It is not very common to save figures using EPS format. 



One disadvantage of R Plotly is when you want to save figures from plotly, you have to use the "screenshot" buttom in RStudio, but the resulting figures is extremely large and high-quality. 



In R, you can use the orca function provided by R Plotly. With the `plotly` R package, you can export graphs you create as static images in the `.png`, `.jpg`/`.jpeg`, `.eps`, `.svg`, and/or `.pdf` formats using [Orca](https://github.com/plotly/orca), an open source command line tool for generating static images of graphs created with [Plotly's graphing libraries](https://plotly.com/graphing-libraries).



### Installation

As described in [Orca](https://github.com/plotly/orca), there are several ways to install `orca` in your machine



#### Method 1: Conda (Recommended)

```bash
$ conda install -c plotly plotly-orca
```





#### Method 2: npm (If you have Node.js installed)

```bash
$ npm install -g electron@6.1.4 orca
```





#### Method 3: Docker

```bash
$ docker pull quay.io/plotly/orca
```





### Orca in RStudio

If you are using Rstudio, you might receive the following error message:

```R
> plotly::orca_serve()
Error: The orca command-line utility is required for this functionality.

Please follow the installation instructions here -- https://github.com/plotly/orca#installation
```

That's because RStudio doesn't recognize the `PATH` environment variables for `conda`. As suggested by [Github issue comment](https://github.com/plotly/orca/issues/120#issuecomment-424000634), you can fix this by telling RStudio where `conda` located.

```R
Sys.setenv("PATH" = paste(Sys.getenv("PATH"), "[Your Conda /bin/ directory]", sep = .Platform$path.sep))
```

Now you are able to use orca in RStudio: 

```R
> Sys.setenv("PATH" = paste(Sys.getenv("PATH"), "/Users/xx/anaconda3/bin/", sep = .Platform$path.sep))
> plotly::orca_serve()
$port
[1] 5151

$process
PROCESS 'orca', running, pid 59108.
```



### Export R Graphics as Static Images using `orca()`

For more details, please visit [plotly official documentation for exporting static graphics in R](https://plotly.com/r/static-image-export/). Here's an example:

```R
library(plotly)

if (!require("processx")) install.packages("processx")
fig <- plot_ly(z = ~volcano) %>% add_surface()
orca(fig, "surface-plot.svg")
```
